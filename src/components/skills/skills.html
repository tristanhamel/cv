        By bread and butter for the last 2 years. It's certainly suffering performance issues in comparison with Angular2 but it remains a good framework, especially with the improvements brought with 1.5 and 1.6 (components, life cycle hooks).

        Define your variables and mixins, import and ensure design consistency. I love SASS!

        It was a relief when I could finally use ES6 at work. It saves time, is easier to read and practically outdated Lodash (for the most part). We still need to compile but let's be bold and dream that, one day there are gonna be only evergreen browsers out there and we'll not need the whole polyfill sheebang.

        Jquery is OK. This page is even using it heavily! But more often than not, it's required in projects which could totally do without (I work with AngularJS right).

        Steep learning curve at first. But what a time saver! Setup in a matter of minutes, not hours. No need anymore to write 100s of lines of Gulp tasks or rely on ill-suited Yeoman generators. Just spin Webpack with minimal config and you are good to go!

        It was a definite improvement when it landed the task generator scene. Now that we got Webpack is it really necessary? I admit it's more flexible but for very specific tasks, one might as well just write plain Node scripts.

        I used it only in hobby projects. It might have too much boilerplate for some. Coming from AngularJS, I still enjoy the improvements on the latter a lot. And the use of the CLI largely offsets the boilerplate problem IMHO.

        "Property x of y is not defined". How many times a JS developer gets bitten by type errors? The solution? Interfaces! Maybe Typescript feels like a lot of useless locs at first but God does it save time in the long run.

        I'm not too familiar with Node. But when needing specialized build task, or spinning a proxy with authentication, routing etc, that's my choice.

        Frameworks are good. Only are they not good for everything. When I see the entire Bootstrap loaded to style a form of 3 inputs, I cry.

        Testing is a must. I haven't tried others as Jasmine has always been serving its purpose. Maybe I should?

        I love Redux! In a complex app with lots of data types and backend sync operations, it really improves maintainability by enforcing unique data management strategies.
